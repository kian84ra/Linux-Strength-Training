# Task 2 – Finding Your Way Around Linux

This task introduces basic file searching using the `find` and `grep` commands. As a Linux user or security researcher, you'll need to locate files and directories based on properties like name, size, owner, group, or content.

# Common `find` Syntax Reference

| Goal | Syntax | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Find file by name | `find [path] -type f -name [filename]` | `find /home -type f -name report.txt` |
| Find directory by name | `find [path] -type d -name [dirname]` | `find / -type d -name logs` |
| Find by size | `find [path] -type f -size [size]` | `find /tmp -type f -size 52k` |
| Find by user | `find [path] -type f -user [username]` | `find /home -type f -user francis` |
| Find by group | `find [path] -type f -group [groupname]` | `find /etc -type f -group teamstar` |
| Find by date modified | `find / -type f -newermt YYYY-MM-DD` | `find / -type f -newermt 2020-06-30` |
| Find files modified on a specific date | `find / -type f -newermt START ! -newermt END` | `find / -type f -newermt 2016-09-11 ! -newermt 2016-09-13` |
| Search for keyword in files | `grep -iRl 'keyword' [path]` | `grep -iRl 'flag' /var/logs` |


# Question 2

**What is the format for finding a file with the user named Francis and with a size of 52 kilobytes in the directory `/home/francis/`?**
      find /home/francis -type f -user francis -size 52k


# Question 3
SSH as topson using his password topson. Go to /home/topson/chatlogs and type the following:
grep -iRl 'keyword'

# Question 4
What are the characters subsequent to the word you found?

Steps:
Open the file found earlier:
less 2019-10-11

Search for the word:
/keyword

Observe what characters immediately follow the keyword.

# Question 5
Read the file named ReadMeIfStuck.txt. What is the flag?
Steps:
Find the file:
find / -type f -name ReadMeIfStuck.txt 2>/dev/null

Read the file:
cat /path/to/ReadMeIfStuck.txt

It may reference another file, like additionalHINT. Find and read it:
find / -type f -name additionalHINT 2>/dev/null
cat /path/to/additionalHINT

Then, find a directory:
find / -type d -name "telephone numbers"

Inside that directory, read a readME.txt, which instructs you to:
Find file by modified date:
find /workflows -type f -newermt 2016-09-11 ! -newermt 2016-09-13

View and search the file for the flag:
less xft/eBQRhHvx
/Flag

# Pro Tips
Use 2>/dev/null to suppress permission errors in find:
find / -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null
