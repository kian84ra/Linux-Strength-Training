# Task 3 – Working With Files

This task focuses on basic Linux file operations like copying, moving, renaming, and creating files and directories. These are fundamental skills every Linux user must master.


# Key Linux Commands for File Management

| Task | Command | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Copy file or folder | `cp [file/folder] [destination]` | `cp ssh.conf /home/newfolder` |
| Move or rename file | `mv [file] [destination/newname]` | `mv ssh.conf /home/backup/` |
| Move multiple files | `mv file1 file2 -t [dest]` | `mv logs.txt notes.txt -t /var/archive` |
| Move all files from current directory | `mv * [destination]` | `mv * /home/francis/logs` |
| Rename folder/file | `mv [oldname] [newname]` | `mv report.txt report_old.txt` |
| Create file | `touch [filename]` | `touch new.txt` |
| Create folder | `mkdir [dirname]` | `mkdir backups` |
| Read file | `cat [file]` / `nano [file]` | `cat info.txt` |
| Run shell script | `./[scriptname]` | `./runme.sh` |
| Upload file to remote system | `scp file user@ip:/path` | `scp test.txt john@192.168.1.10:/home/john/` |
| Handle files starting with `-` | `cp -- -weird.txt /home` | `mv -- -logs -newlogs` |

# Note on Filenames with Special Characters

# If a file or folder name begins with a `-`, Linux may treat it as an option. Use `--` to stop option parsing, like so:
mv -- -logs -newlogs

# Transfer script.py from /home/james/Desktop/ to remote machine 192.168.10.5 under /home/john/scripts using user john
scp /home/james/Desktop/script.py john@192.168.10.5:/home/john/scripts

# Move all files in current directory to /home/francis/logs
mv * /home/francis/logs

# Copy file encryption keys (with space in name) to /home/john/logs
cp "encryption keys" /home/john/logs

### Find readME_hint.txt inside Topson’s directory, follow instructions inside, and get the second flag.
## Steps:
# Step 1: Locate the file
find /home/topson -type f -name readME_hint.txt 2>/dev/null

# Step 2: Read the file
cat /home/topson/readME_hint.txt

This file gives instructions. Likely:
mv -- -MoveMe.txt "-march folder"/
cd -- -march\ folder/
cat [flag file]

# Additional Practice Commands
touch sample.txt
mkdir testFolder
cp sample.txt testFolder/
mv sample.txt renamed.txt
mv renamed.txt /home/user/
scp renamed.txt john@192.168.0.100:/home/john/
