# Task 4 – Hashing: Introduction

This task covers the basics of **hashing**, why it matters in cybersecurity, and how to crack hashes using tools like **John the Ripper**.

# What Is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of taking an input (e.g., password) and converting it into a fixed-length string using an algorithm like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. This string:

- Is **unique** (in theory)
- Is **irreversible** (one-way)
- Cannot be "decrypted" — only cracked by brute-force


# Why Hashing Is Important

- Passwords are stored as **hashes**, not plain text
- Useful for **integrity verification**
- Some hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) are vulnerable to **collision attacks**

# How to Crack Hashes with John the Ripper

### Step-by-Step:

1. Save the hash in a text file (e.g., `hash.txt`)
2. Identify the type of hash (optional):
   hash-identifier

3. Run John with the appropriate format and wordlist:
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

4. To show the cracked password:
john --show hash.txt

If rockyou.txt is not extracted:
gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz


| Tool                   | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `john`                 | Cracks hashed passwords                 |
| `hash-identifier`      | Detects hash type                       |
| `haiti`                | Modern alternative to `hash-identifier` |
| `md5sum` / `sha256sum` | Creates hashes manually                 |

Q1: Download the hash file and crack the MD5 hash. What is the password?
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Q2: What is the hash type stored in the file hashA.txt?
You can use:
cat hashA.txt | hash-identifier

Q3: Crack hashA.txt using John the Ripper. What is the password?
john --format=raw-md4 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashA.txt
john --show hashA.txt

Q4: What is the hash type stored in hashB.txt?
cat hashB.txt | hash-identifier

Q5: Find a wordlist with .mnf extension and use it to crack hashC.txt. What is the password?
Find .mnf wordlist:
find / -type f -name "*.mnf" 2>/dev/null
Run John with custom wordlist:
john --format=raw-sha256 --wordlist=/path/to/wordlist.mnf hashC.txt
john --show hashC.txt

Q6: Crack hashB.txt using John the Ripper. What is the password?
john --format=raw-sha1 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashB.txt
john --show hashB.txt
