# Task 5 – Decoding Base64

This task introduces **Base64 encoding and decoding** — a method of converting binary data to ASCII text, and back.

# What is Base64?

Base64 is a **binary-to-text encoding scheme** used to represent binary data in a readable ASCII string format.  
For example:
```text
Original text: example  
Base64 encoded: ZXhhbXBsZQ==


| Action                      | Command                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Decode base64               | `base64 -d`                                  |
| Encode to base64            | `base64`                                     |
| Pipe from file              | `cat file.txt \| base64 -d`                  |
| Save decoded output to file | `cat encoded.txt \| base64 -d > decoded.txt` |

Q1: What is the name of the tool which allows us to decode base64 strings?
Answer:
base64

Q2: Find a file called encoded.txt. What is the special answer?
Steps:
Find the file:
find / -type f -name encoded.txt 2>/dev/null
Decode its contents:
cat encoded.txt | base64 -d
