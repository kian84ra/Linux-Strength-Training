# Task 6 – Encryption & Decryption using GPG

In this task, we learn to use **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** to encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric encryption with the **AES** algorithm.

# What is Encryption?

**Encryption** converts readable data into a secure format using a key or password. It protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.

There are two main types:

- **Symmetric**: Same password is used to encrypt and decrypt (this is what GPG uses here)
- **Asymmetric**: Uses a key-pair (public/private)

# AES Encryption

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a secure encryption algorithm. Common versions include:

- AES-128
- AES-256 (stronger)

We can use **GPG** to encrypt using either algorithm.

# How to Encrypt with GPG

**Command:**
gpg --cipher-algo [AES-128|AES-256] --symmetric [file]
gpg --cipher-algo AES-128 --symmetric history_logs.txt

# How to Decrypt with GPG
Command:
gpg [encrypted_file.gpg]
If it prompts for a password, enter the same one used during encryption.

Example:
gpg history_logs.txt.gpg

 Q1: You wish to encrypt a file called history_logs.txt using AES-128. What is the full command?
gpg --cipher-algo AES-128 --symmetric history_logs.txt

Q2: What is the command to decrypt the file you just encrypted?
gpg history_logs.txt.gpg

Q3: Find an encrypted file called layer4.txt, its password is bob. Use this to locate the flag.
Steps:
# Locate the file
find / -type f -name layer4.txt.gpg 2>/dev/null

# Decrypt with password
gpg layer4.txt.gpg
# (Enter: bob when prompted)
# View the decrypted file
cat layer4.txt

Practice Activity
Create a file:
echo "Linux is awesome!" > mynotes.txt
Encrypt it:
gpg --cipher-algo AES-256 --symmetric mynotes.txt
Decrypt it:
gpg mynotes.txt.gpg

# Tips
GPG caches passwords during a session. If it doesn't ask, reboot or try on another machine.

Always read man gpg for more options.
