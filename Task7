# Task 7 – Cracking Encrypted GPG Files

In this task, we simulate a **real-world attack scenario** where we **do not know the password** for a `.gpg` file and attempt to brute-force it using **John the Ripper** and **gpg2john**.

# What is `gpg2john`?

`gpg2john` is a tool that extracts a hash from a `.gpg` file so that John the Ripper can try to crack it.

# Tools Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gpg2john` | Extract hash from `.gpg` file |
| `john` | Brute-force passwords |
| `tac` | Reverse a wordlist file |
| `gpg` | Decrypt the file manually after cracking |


# Full Process to Crack a GPG File

Step 1: Generate a Hash from the `.gpg` File
gpg2john personal.txt.gpg > personal.hash

Step 2: Reverse the Wordlist Using tac
tac data.txt > reversed_data.txt

Step 3: Crack the Password Using John the Ripper
john --wordlist=reversed_data.txt --format=gpg personal.hash
John will output the password once cracked.

Step 4: Decrypt the File Using GPG
gpg personal.txt.gpg
Then enter the cracked password when prompted.

 Q2: What is written in the now decrypted file?
cat personal.txt
Answer:
