# Task 9 – Final Challenge

This final challenge incorporates all the Linux skills you've learned throughout the room. You'll need to navigate directories, read files, find passwords, and escalate privileges.

# Challenge Walkthrough

### Step 1: Access the chat logs
cd /home/shared/chatlogs
ls -la
cat LpnQ

 **Observation**: The chat log contains conversations between users that may include passwords or clues.

### Step 2: Find Sameer's SSH password
1. Examine the chat logs carefully:
cat LpnQ | grep -i "password"
2. You'll find the line:  
   *"Sameer: I set my SSH password to 'thegreatestpasswordever000'"*

### Step 3: Find SQL database backup password
1. Look for database-related files:
find /home/shared -name "*.sql" -o -name "*.db"
2. Check backup files:
cat /home/shared/db_backup.txt
3. You'll find credentials:  
   *"Backup password: ebqattle"*

### Step 4: Find James' SSH password
1. Check other chat logs:
cat /home/shared/chatlogs/*
2. In file `XyZt`, you'll find:  
   *"James: My new password is vuimaxcullings"*

### Step 5: SSH as James and escalate to root
1. Connect via SSH:
ssh james@[MACHINE_IP]
# Password: vuimaxcullings
2. Check sudo privileges:
sudo -l
3. Escalate to root:
sudo su
# Enter James' password when prompted

### Step 6: Find the root flag
1. Navigate to root directory:
cd /root
ls
2. View the flag:
cat root.txt

# Pro Tips
- Use `grep -i` for case-insensitive searches
- Check file permissions with `ls -la`
- Use `sudo -l` to check available privileges
- Remember command history can be viewed with `history`
